http://localhost:8761/actuator
Meaning

_links → A standard HAL property that lists available hypermedia links.

self → The current resource (in this case, the root Actuator endpoint).

href → The URL for the resource.

Here it’s "http://localhost:8761/actuator", meaning the base actuator endpoint.

templated: false → Means the URL is not a URI template (it’s a fixed URL, not something like /actuator/{id}).

1. What is /actuator/beans?

A Spring Boot Actuator endpoint.

Shows all beans registered in the Spring ApplicationContext.

Each bean entry contains:

Bean name (ID in context)

Bean type (class)

Scope (singleton, prototype, etc.)

Dependencies (what it depends on)

2. Where do beans come from?

✅ Beans can be created from:

Your code → classes annotated with @Component, @Service, @Repository, @Controller, or defined via @Bean.

Spring Boot Starters (dependencies in pom.xml) → auto-configurations create beans automatically.

Third-party libraries → if they have Spring configuration (e.g., Spring Data JPA).

3. Relationship: pom.xml dependency → beans

If a dependency includes Spring Boot auto-config, it will register beans.

If it’s just a utility library, no beans will be created.

Examples:

Dependency	What beans it contributes
spring-boot-starter-web	DispatcherServlet, Controllers, HandlerMapping, MessageConverters
spring-boot-starter-data-jpa	EntityManagerFactory, JpaRepositories, TransactionManager
spring-boot-starter-security	SecurityFilterChain, AuthenticationManager, PasswordEncoder
mysql-connector-java	DataSource (if DB properties are set)
spring-boot-starter-actuator	Actuator endpoints (like /actuator/beans)
commons-lang3	❌ No beans (only utility classes)
4. Why is /actuator/beans useful?

Debugging: check what beans are loaded and avoid duplicates.

Dependency Check: confirm if a starter actually created the beans.

Troubleshooting: if something doesn’t work, see if the expected bean exists.
5. Key takeaway

👉 /actuator/beans = live snapshot of ApplicationContext beans.
👉 Beans come from your code + dependencies that auto-register beans.
👉 Not every dependency creates beans (e.g., pure utility JARs).

. Relationship between Dependencies & Beans

Not every dependency = beans.

Some dependencies only provide utility code (e.g., Apache Commons Lang → no beans, just helper classes).

Some dependencies register beans automatically using @Configuration + @ConditionalOnClass (e.g., Spring Boot starters).




📘 Notes on actuator/caches in Spring Boot
1. What is /actuator/caches?

An Actuator endpoint.

Shows all caches registered in your app.

Example:
{
  "cacheManagers": {
    "cacheManager": {
      "caches": {
        "users": {
          "target": "ConcurrentMapCache",
          "name": "users"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
And add a cache provider like:

Redis

Caffeine

EhCache

Hazelcast

Simple in-memory (ConcurrentMapCache) (default if no provider).
@Service
public class UserService {
    @Cacheable("users")  // stores in Redis under key "users"
    public User getUser(Long id) {
        // DB call (expensive)
        return userRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow();
    }
}


4. What /actuator/caches shows with Redis

Cache manager = RedisCacheManager

Cache name = "users"

Actuator tells you all caches created via @Cacheable, @CachePut, @CacheEvict.

{
  "cacheManagers": {
    "cacheManager": {
      "caches": {
        "users": {
          "target": "RedisCache",
          "name": "users"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
Why useful in enterprise apps?

✅ Helps monitor caches (are they registered properly?)

✅ Debug cache misses vs hits

✅ Ensure correct cache provider (Redis vs in-memory)

✅ Crucial for scaling apps (DB load reduction, performance boost).

👉 In simple terms:

/actuator/caches = list of cache "containers" your app uses.

Redis (or others) = the "engine" behind those caches.
How multiple caches work

When you use @Cacheable("users"), Spring tells the cache manager:
➝ “Store/fetch this method’s results in the cache named users.”

If you also use @Cacheable("products"), it creates (or uses) another cache region called products.

So you can have different logical caches in one app, each isolated.
. With Actuator /caches

Actuator will show you all the caches registered in your app.

Example:

{
  "cacheManagers": {
    "cacheManager": {
      "caches": {
        "users": { "target": "redisCache" },
        "products": { "target": "redisCache" },
        "orders": { "target": "redisCache" }
      }
    }
  }
}

How to clear one specific cache

You can evict all entries of a specific cache via Actuator:


DELETE http://localhost:8080/actuator/caches/users


➡️ This clears only the users cache.
➡️ Similarly, for products:

DELETE http://localhost:8080/actuator/caches/products




The http://localhost:8761/actuator/health endpoint is one of the most important Spring Boot Actuator endpoints.

Here’s a breakdown in simple terms:

🔹 What it does:

It shows the health status of your application.

By default, it only shows "status": "UP" if the app is healthy.

If something is wrong (DB down, Redis unreachable, etc.), it shows "DOWN".
{
  "status": "UP"
}

in an enterprise application, you’re really asking:

👉 “Is my app healthy enough to serve traffic?”

🔹 What “UP” means in an enterprise app

In banking, fintech, insurance, or any large-scale enterprise system, "status": "UP" does not only mean the JVM is running. It means:

Core Infra Checks

Database (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL) → reachable & valid query works

Cache (Redis, Hazelcast) → connected

Message Brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ) → producing/consuming OK

File Storage (S3, NAS, GCS) → accessible

Disk space threshold is fine

External APIs (payment gateways, KYC services, credit score providers, etc.) → reachable

Security Checks

Keystore/certificates valid (not expired)

Token provider (Keycloak, OAuth2 server) reachable

Custom Business Health Indicators

“Can I process a transaction end-to-end?”

“Are pending jobs in the queue under acceptable threshold?”

“Fraud detection engine responding?”

🔹 Example Enterprise /actuator/health Response

When management.endpoint.health.show-details=always is enabled, you might see:

{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": { "status": "UP", "details": { "database": "Oracle", "validationQuery": "isValid()" } },
    "diskSpace": { "status": "UP", "details": { "free": 123456789, "threshold": 10485760, "path": "/" } },
    "redis": { "status": "UP", "details": { "version": "7.0.12" } },
    "kafka": { "status": "UP", "details": { "brokers": "3 online" } },
    "s3": { "status": "UP", "details": { "bucket": "bank-docs", "region": "ap-south-1" } },
    "paymentGateway": { "status": "UP", "details": { "latencyMs": 120 } },
    "authServer": { "status": "UP", "details": { "issuer": "https://keycloak.company.com" } }
  }
}

🔹 Enterprise Usage

Kubernetes / Docker → liveness & readiness probes hit /actuator/health to decide if pod gets traffic.

Load Balancers (AWS ELB, Nginx, F5) → remove instance if "DOWN".

Monitoring Tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk, Datadog) → alert DevOps/SRE if any sub-component is unhealthy.

✅ In short:
In enterprise apps, "UP" at /actuator/health means:

All infrastructure dependencies are fine.

All security layers are fine.

All business-critical flows can execute successfully.


🔹 What are HealthIndicators?

In Spring Boot Actuator, HealthIndicator is a contract (interface) that tells the health of a part of your system.

Example:

DataSourceHealthIndicator → checks DB connection.

DiskSpaceHealthIndicator → checks if you have enough free disk space.

RedisHealthIndicator → checks Redis availability.

MongoHealthIndicator → checks MongoDB connection.

CustomHealthIndicator → you can write your own (e.g., check if a third-party API is reachable).

🔹 How does http://localhost:8761/actuator/health work?

When you call /actuator/health, Spring Boot runs all registered HealthIndicators.

It aggregates their status into a single response:

{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "db": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": { "database": "PostgreSQL", "hello": 1 }
    },
    "diskSpace": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": { "total": 499963174912, "free": 34234323423, "threshold": 10485760 }
    },
    "redis": {
      "status": "UP"
    }
  }
}

🔹 Enterprise Usage

In big apps (like banking, e-commerce, etc.):

Load balancers (NGINX, AWS ELB, Kubernetes, API Gateway, Eureka, Consul) keep pinging /actuator/health.

If status = UP → traffic is sent to the app.

If status = DOWN → app is removed from the pool (so no customer request goes there).

✅ In short:

HealthIndicators = little health checkers for each dependency.

/actuator/health = runs all of them and returns UP/DOWN.

Enterprise systems (K8s, AWS, Eureka) call this endpoint to know if your app is healthy.


"db": {
  "status": "UP",
  "details": {
    "database": "PostgreSQL",
    "hello": 1
  }
}
comes from Spring Boot Actuator’s HealthIndicator for the database.

Here’s how it knows:

Spring Boot auto-detects a DataSource

When you add a DB dependency (e.g. PostgreSQL driver) and configure spring.datasource.*, Spring creates a DataSource bean.

Actuator automatically wires in a DataSourceHealthIndicator.

It runs a validation query

By default, Spring just executes SELECT 1 (or database-specific equivalent like SELECT 1 FROM DUAL for Oracle).

In your JSON, "hello": 1 is the result of that test query.

If the query succeeds → status = "UP"
If it fails (timeout, connection refused, invalid creds, etc.) → status = "DOWN" with error details.

Why useful in enterprise apps

Monitoring systems (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Kubernetes liveness/readiness probes, AWS ALB health checks, etc.) call /actuator/health.

If "db" is "DOWN", they know the service cannot access its DB and can trigger alerts, auto-restart, or reroute traffic.

👉 In simple words:
Spring checks the DB by running a tiny test query. If the DB answers, status is UP. If not, it’s DOWN.
